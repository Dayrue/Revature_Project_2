Your goal is to make a menu that takes finds the whether or not the user wants to:

1. Do a Where statment AND a Group By
2. Do a Where statment AND NO group By
3. Do just a Group By 
4. Just the normal select statment

Look at my class and its methods to make sure you are passing the correct values into them otherwise it wont work

Here is some example code from my testing. Note that this might not work right out of the bat because I had this defined in my class and methods before:


#The imports you will need:
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pandas as pd
from spark_functions import SparkQuerrying

#This builds the spark session 
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

#This takes the data and first turns it into a pandas dataframe then in made into a spark dataframe
data = pd.read_csv("csvGenerator/data.csv")
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(data)



# print("How many columns do you want to select?")
# print(f"The columns you can select are: {spark_df.columns}")
# colInput = input("Please list the columns you would like: ").split(',')

# whereQ = input("Would you like to add an conditional (yes/no): ")
# groupQ = input("Would you like to group data (yes/no): ")

### I would define this right after you get the whereQ, groupQ, and colInput then just use obj.(name of method)(method args)

# obj = SparkQuerrying(spark_df,whereQ,groupQ,colInput) 
# obj.Select()

        # aggreagteFunctions = ['count','max','min','first','last', 'mean','sum']

        # if whereQ.lower() == 'yes' and groupQ.lower() == 'yes':
        #     print(colInput)
        #     print("What is the conditional you would like to use? For example: orderID > 10 ")
        #     whereCon = input("Please input: ")
        #     print("What column do you want to group by?", colInput)
        #     groupByVar = input("Please input: ")

        #     keys = input("Please input the column names you want to aggreagte: ").split(',')
        #     print(aggreagteFunctions)
        #     values = input("Please input the functions you would like to use: ").split(',')
